# DECOMPOSE: Clarification

## Context

Clarify the decomposition scope for a complex/very_complex task.
Skip this step if scope is already clear from the user query.

---

## Focus Areas

1. **Task Boundaries**
   - What is in scope vs out of scope?
   - Are there external dependencies?
   - What are the completion criteria?

2. **Decomposition Constraints**
   - Are there mandatory subtask groupings?
   - Are there ordering requirements?
   - Are there resource constraints?

3. **Stakeholder Expectations**
   - What is the expected output format?
   - Are there quality requirements per subtask?
   - Are there timeline constraints?
