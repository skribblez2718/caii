# TREE OF THOUGHT EXPLORATION

Explore multiple solution approaches before committing.

## Instructions

Generate and evaluate alternative approaches:

1. **Generate Alternative Approaches (2-3 paths)**

   **Path A: Skill Orchestration**
   - Invoke a composite skill matching the task pattern
   - Structured multi-phase cognitive workflow
   - Best for tasks matching defined skill patterns

   **Path B: Dynamic Skill Sequencing**
   - Orchestrator determines sequence of orchestrate-* atomic skills
   - Flexible cognitive workflow for novel tasks
   - Best for tasks requiring multiple cognitive functions

2. **Evaluate Viability**
   - Assess each path against the specific requirements
   - Consider complexity, risk, and resource requirements
   - Identify blockers or constraints for each path

3. **Compare Trade-offs**
   - What does each path optimize for?
   - What does each path sacrifice?
   - How does each path handle uncertainty?

4. **Select Optimal Path**
   - Choose the path with best risk/reward profile
   - Provide clear justification for selection
   - Document what would change the decision

## Output Requirements

After processing this step, present:
- 2-3 alternative approaches with descriptions
- Viability assessment for each
- Trade-off comparison
- Selected path with justification
